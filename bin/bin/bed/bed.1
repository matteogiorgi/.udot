* Standard cursor movement controls

* Select text by holding Shift
* Clipboard functionality: cut, copy, and paste
________________________________________________________________________________

* No undo
* No search
* No line wrap
* Can only edit one file at a time

________________________________________________________________________________

* About 30 KB free disk space
* Linux console, or an XTerm-compatible terminal emulator
* Bash shell, version 4+ (note: tested on 5.0.17)
* GNU coreutils (cat, tr, stty)
* ncurses (tput, reset)
* xclip to use the X selection as the clipboard (optional)

________________________________________________________________________________

User preferences may be configured in ~/.bedrc, which is simply a Bash script
sourced by bed. This is probably a security risk, but bed is not designed
for serious usage anyway

________________________________________________________________________________

To achieve acceptable performance in bed:
    * Uses Bash built-ins whenever possible
    * Avoids subshells by using global variables to return values from functions
    * Only redraws the parts of the display that changed since the last frame
