# This scrip sets CapsLock as a second
# SuperKey and as Escape on a single key-press.
# As an alternative just maps CapsLock as Escape
# with the following lines:
#
#   xmodmap -e 'remove Lock = Caps_Lock'
#   xmodmap -e 'keysym Caps_Lock = Escape'
#   xmodmap -e 'add Lock = Caps_Lock'


if [[ -x "$(command -v xmodmap)" ]]; then
    xmodmap -e 'remove Lock = Caps_Lock'
    xmodmap -e 'keysym Caps_Lock = Super_L'
    xmodmap -e 'add mod4 = Super_L'
    xmodmap -e 'keycode 66 = Escape'
