# This scrip sets CapsLock as SuperKey plus Escape on a single key-press.
# As alternative you can simply set CapsLock as Escape with the following
# commands with xmodmap: xmodmap -e 'remove Lock = Caps_Lock'
#                        xmodmap -e 'keysym Caps_Lock = Escape'
#                        xmodmap -e 'add Lock = Caps_Lock'

    xmodmap -e 'remove Lock = Caps_Lock'
    xmodmap -e 'keysym Caps_Lock = Super_L'
    xmodmap -e 'add mod4 = Super_L'
    xmodmap -e 'keycode 66 = Escape'
