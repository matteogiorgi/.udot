Features
________________________________________________________________________________

* Standard cursor movement controls
  * Move the cursor using the arrow keys, Home, End, PgUp, PgDn
  * Move by words by holding Ctrl
* Select text by holding Shift
* Clipboard functionality: cut, copy, and paste
*Not supported in the Linux console, because it does not report modifier keys


Limitations
________________________________________________________________________________

* No undo
* No search
* No line wrap
* Can only edit one file at a time


System Requirements
________________________________________________________________________________

* About 30 KB free disk space
* Linux console, or an XTerm-compatible terminal emulator
* Bash shell, version 4+ (note: tested on 5.0.17)
* GNU coreutils (cat, tr, stty)
* ncurses (tput, reset)
* xclip to use the X selection as the clipboard (optional)


Configuration
________________________________________________________________________________

User preferences may be configured in ~/.bashedrc, which is simply a Bash script
sourced by bashed. This is probably a security risk, but bashed is not designed
for serious usage anyway


Performance
________________________________________________________________________________

Bash is not known for being particularly fast. To achieve acceptable performance,
bashed:

* Uses Bash built-ins whenever possible
* Avoids subshells by using global variables to return values from functions
* Only redraws the parts of the display that changed since the last frame
