# Ubuntu-Dotfiles

These repo contains a minimal configuration of my dotfiles, I keep them organized using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) and they are ment to be used alongside a vanilla install of [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/#download). The scripts are in good order and well readable but there wont be no more than the bare essentials.
