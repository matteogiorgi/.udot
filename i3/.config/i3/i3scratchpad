# This script spawns an scratchpad as long as i3 is running (it needs st)
# It is very usefull if you want a terminal scratchpad always available.

# I usually have the following lines in my i3 config file too, in order
# to make this script work properly:
#
#   for_window [instance="scratchpad"] floating enable;
#              [instance="scratchpad"] resize set 800 600;
#              [instance="scratchpad"] move scratchpad
#
#   bindsym $mod+Shift+Return [instance="scratchpad"] scratchpad show;
#                             [instance="scratchpad"] move position center


while pgrep -x "i3"; do
    st -n scratchpad -e tmux &
    wait $!
done
